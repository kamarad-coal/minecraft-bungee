## Versioning

Bungee builds support for each Github tag. The format for container tags is the following:

```
quay.io/kamaradcoal/minecraft-bungee:[repo_tag]
```

For example, this is going to be the `1.0`tag

```
quay.io/kamaradcoal/minecraft-bungee:1.0-latest
```

### Version Specific Tags

For version-specific tags, you might use the following image and tag, `1.0.0` being the repo tag:

```
quay.io/kamaradcoal/minecraft-bungee:1.0.0
```

### Majors and Minor versions

You can also specify major repo versions, where `1.0` means `1.0.x`:

```
quay.io/kamaradcoal/minecraft-bungee:1.0
```

You can also specify major.minor repo versions, where `1` means `1.x` (all 1.x versions):

```
quay.io/kamaradcoal/minecraft-bungee:1
```

### Latest Tags

For latest tags, use `latest` instead:

```
quay.io/kamaradcoal/minecraft-bungee:latest
```

## Kubernetes Integration

Coming soon.
